## User Validation & Feedback 📊

As part of validating our MVP, we collected feedback from real testnet users via Google Forms. 
You can view the raw exported responses and feedback analysis in our Excel sheet below:

*(Note: Please replace `<link-to-your-excel-sheet-here>` with the actual Google Drive or Excel link!)*

### 👥 Testnet User Validations
To validate our real-world MVP, we tested the platform with 5+ real testnet users using Freighter wallets. Here are their verified Stellar wallet addresses:
1. `User 1 Wallet Address Here`
2. `User 2 Wallet Address Here`
3. `User 3 Wallet Address Here`
4. `User 4 Wallet Address Here`
5. `User 5 Wallet Address Here`

### MVP Iteration & Future Improvements 🛠️

Based on the initial user feedback, we've planned and started implementing key improvements. Here is our first completed iteration directly requested by users:

**Iteration 1: Wallet Connection UX Improvement**
*Feedback*: Users felt anxious during the wallet connection phase because there was no visual feedback that a background request was happening.
*Improvement*: Added dynamic loading states and spinners to the "Connect Wallet" button on the Landing Page.
- **[View Git Commit for this Iteration](https://github.com/payalbabar/GasChainProject/commit/a4bf2c1db2a343d22c584a5527aef92f2041f60e)**

**Future Roadmap Based on User Feedback:**
- **Enhanced Payment Tracking**: Users want to see XLM transaction links directly in the dashboard after booking.
- **Onboarding Tooltips**: 2 users suggested that first-time onboarding for Freighter wallet should have a guided "How to Connect" modal.
